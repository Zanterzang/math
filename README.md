# Introducing...
Just a regular old simple calculator. Right? Right??? Well, yes for now. It's supposed to be more than that but it is in its first stage where its a very simple calculator. Additions, subtractions, multiplications and divisions is all it can do. Brackets were buggy previously but have now been fixed. The "complexer" button doesn't do anything yet but it's supposed to be the whole "quirk" of this calculator.
# Updates: 
- v1: A simple arithmetic calculator.
    - v1.1: bugs regarding brackets fixed.
